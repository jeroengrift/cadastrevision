## This repository
In this repository, we publish two types of FME pipelines:
- fme/benchmark_preperation: preprocess the restricted data from CadastreVision (Planetscope and SuperView)
- fme/overlap_calculation: perform the overlap analysis between the cadastral boundaries from the CadastreVision dataset and physical topographic objects from several topographic maps 

## Software requirements
Make sure FME Workbench 2024.0 is installed on your machine. Installation manuals and software documentation are available at: [https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-Form/Home.htm](https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-Form/Home.htm 'https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-Form/Home.htm')
